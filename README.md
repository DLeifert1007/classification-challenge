# classification-challenge

As an Internet Service Provider employee I have been tasked with improving the email filtering system for our customers. The dataset contains the information about the emails with two classifications of either spam or not spam. I will take this dataset and develop a supervised machine learning model using both Logistic Regression and random forest models in order to best accurately detect spam emails and filter them out of the customers' inboxes. I will evauluate which model, Logistic Regression or random forest, is more accurate at detecting the spam mail. 

In this first section of code I have split the data into training and testing sets at 75% training and 25% testing. Next the features were scaled which allows the data to accurately be compared as the scaler.transform gets the adjusted and scaled data throughout both the training and testing data.
